**** Spawning time ****

Time to make a minon!
    cd ..
    cp -r minion_skeleton minion1
    cd minion1
    mv start_minion.sh start_minion1.sh

Open start_minion.sh and etc/local.ini and change all
    minion_skeleton
to
    minion1

In etc/local.ini change the uuid from "change_me_later" to an actual uuid. Ask
a running couchdb /_uuids for one.
And do not forget to change xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx to an ip.

Open etc/vm.args and change
    {{node_name}}
to
    -name minion1@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

where xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is the IP of the server you are going to run it on.

If you are going to run more than one minion per server, you have to change the
ports(45984,45986) as well.

Repeat until you have all the minions you want.

**** Deploy ****

You can now move the minions to their servers.
If your servers run different versions, distributions and what not, you
probably know how to deal with it :)

**** Boot ****

Run ./start_minionX.sh on every server to start the cluster.

**** Connect Cluster ****

Go to http://server1:45984/_membership to see the name of the node and all the
nodes it knows about and are connected too.
    curl -X PUT "http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:45984/_membership" --user daboss

{"all_nodes":["minion1@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"],"cluster_nodes":["minion1@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"]}

"all_nodes" are all the nodes thats this node knows about.
"cluster_nodes" are the nodes that are connected to this node.

Time to add a node:
    curl -X PUT "http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:45986/_nodes/minion2@yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy" -d {}

Now look at http://server1:45984/_membership again.

{"all_nodes":["minion1@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx","minion2@yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy"],"cluster_nodes":["minion1@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx","minion2@yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy"]}

A 2 node cluster! \ö/

http://yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy:45984/_membership will show the same thing, so you only
have to add a node once.

Repeat until all nodes are connected.

**** Shutdown ****

Ctrl+C in the shell you ran ./start_minionX.sh to shut down a node.

**** Start ****

Run ./start_minionX.sh to start a node.

**** END ****
